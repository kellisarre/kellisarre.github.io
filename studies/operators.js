//// 1) assignment operators ////
/*
 = basic assignment
 += adds and reassigns
 -= subtracts and reassigns
 *= multiplies and reassigns
 /= divides and reassigns
 %= finds remainder and reassigns */

//// 2) arithmetic operators ///
/*
+ addition
- subtraction
* multuply
/ divide
% modulo
++ increment
-- decrement */

//// 3) comparison operators ////
/*
>
<
==
===
*/

//// 4) logical operators ////
/*
&& logical and operator
|| logical or operator
! logical not operator */

//// 5) unary operators ////
/* takes a single operand */

/*
! LOGICAL NOT, BANG or INVERSE converts to boolean and inverts truthiness
        if (!true) {console.log("Not true");}
typeof - TYPEOF returns string stating the type of the the value given
        console.log(typeof [];) // "array"
+  CONCATS
-  NEGATES 
delete - DELETES index of an array or specific prop of an object
void - DISCARDS return value */


//// 6) ternary operator ////
/* takes 3 operands
also known as a "conditional operand", it is the only one in JS that works on 3 values 

// format:
// (condition) ? (return this if true) : (return this if false) */
